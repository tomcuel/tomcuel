# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

I’m an engineering student at **ENSTA Paris** specializing in **Applied Mathematics** and **Data Science**.
I enjoy coding projects to apply theoretical tools in practice, write clean code, improve my coding skills, learn new things, and constantly challenge myself.  

Below are the projects I’ve worked on:

### 🧠 Deep Neural Network from Scratch *(Work in Progress)*
[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/tomcuel/Deep_Neural_Network_from_Scratch) · **Python**  
Feedforward Deep Neural Network implemented from scratch in Python, with optional TensorFlow and PyTorch versions for practice. 
Includes training and evaluation on common scikit-learn datasets (Iris, Wine Quality, Breast Cancer, MNIST) and a simple CNN for small-scale computer vision tasks (cat vs dog images). 
Designed for hands-on learning of neural network fundamentals and framework usage.

### 📈 Stock Market Simulation & Trading Bot *(Work in Progress)*
[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/tomcuel/Stock_Market_Trading_App) · **C++ / SQL / Python**  
Simulation of a stock market environment with Basic market features implemented (orders, actions) *(Work in Progress)*, Client–server architecture for interaction *(Work in Progress)*, Random bots trading in the market *(Next Step)*, Design and implementation of the Trading Bot AI, combining coding and financial mathematics *(Next Step)*

### ♟️ Chess Engine
[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/tomcuel/Upgraded_C_Chess_Engine) · **C**  
A full chess engine coded in C with an SDL-based graphical interface. 
The project implements the complete game logic, a functional UI, and an AI opponent. 
The AI combines transposition tables, iterative deepening, and an opening book with optimized move generation for better performance. 
Additional features include a refined interface and keyboard shortcuts to streamline testing.

### 🏃 Boulogne Half Marathon Analysis
[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/tomcuel/Boulogne_Half_Marathon_Analysis) · **Python / SQL**  
App for analyzing Boulogne Half Marathon 2024 results. 
Built with Tkinter (app interface) and an SQL database (race data + client info with encrypted passwords). 
Uses Pandas/Numpy for processing and K-Means clustering to classify runner pacing strategies.

### 🧮 Study Projects
[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/tomcuel/Study_Projects) · **C · C++ · Python · MATLAB · R**  
Collection of academic projects covering:
- Differentiable optimization (Newton’s method, proximal methods)  
- Finite Element simulations for PDEs and fluid dynamics  
- Trajectory planning and vehicle dynamics (Shell Eco-Marathon Challenge)  
- Statistical learning (classification of raisins dataset)  
- Real estate market time series analysis  
- The first draft of my chess engine 

### 🎄 Advent Of Code
[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/tomcuel/Advent_Of_Code) · **Python**  
Algorithmic challenges from the Advent of Code event.
A playground for improving problem-solving, efficiency, and clean coding.
