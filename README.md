# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

I’m an engineering student at **ENSTA Paris** specializing in **Applied Mathematics** and **Data Science**.
I enjoy coding projects to apply theoretical tools in practice, write clean code, improve my coding skills, learn new things, and constantly challenge myself.  

Below are the projects I’ve worked on:
* [Stock Market Simulation & Trading Bot (Work in Progress)](#stock-market-simulation)
* [Stock Price Trading Strategies (Work in Progress)](#stock-price-trading-strategies)
* [Deep Neural Network from Scratch](#deep-neural-network-from-scratch)
* [Credit & Fraud Prediction](#credit-fraud-prediction)
* [Chess Engine](#chess-engine)
* [Boulogne Half Marathon Analysis](#boulogne-half-marathon-analysis)
* [Continual Learning Experiments](#continual-learning-experiments)
* [Study Projects](#study-projects)
* [Advent Of Code](#advent-of-code)

<h3 id="stock-market-simulation">📈 Stock Market Simulation & Trading Bot (Work in Progress)</h3>

[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/tomcuel/Stock_Market_Trading_App) · **C++ / SQL / Python**  
Simulation of a stock market environment with basic market features implemented (orders, actions, expiration dates, ...), client–server architecture for interaction through sockets, random bots trading in the market, design and implementation of the Trading Bot combining Reinforcement Learning, RNN/Transformers and financial mathematics

<h3 id="stock-price-trading-strategies">📊 Stock Price Trading Strategies (Work in Progress)</h3>

[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/tomcuel/Stock_Price_Trading_Strategies) · **Python / TensorFlow / PyTorch**  
Implementation and comparison of various stock price trading strategies including DCA, High-Frequency trading, OCR Sentiment analysis, Random picking comparaison, on several index to observe their differences in portfolio growth over time,
with the full machine learning pipelines including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation to build the model that trading strategies rely on to make buy/sell decisions.
A Streamlit app provides an interactive interface for users to test different strategies and visualize their performance, on several stock indices from online API data sources.
Also includes experiments for educational purposes on stock price forecasting using LSTM and different Transformer architectures (encoder-only, encoder-decoder models, ...), 
with different outputs: next-day price prediction, multi-step forecasting, and trend classification.

<h3 id="deep-neural-network-from-scratch">🧠 Deep Neural Network from Scratch</h3>
